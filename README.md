# link.Tree

linkTree is an ingenious work-around to instagram's policy of not allowing hyperlinks in posts. It's a simple concept that allows you to get a short link in your bio that, when clicked, leads to a webpage with a list of links you want active. From there, your audience can choose one and get directed to the content they’re looking for. 
For example, let’s say you’re a food blogger and you posted two recipes in the last week: one for spaghetti and one for baked potatoes. Without a product like Linktree, you’d have to say “link to recipe in bio” on each post, and then decide which recipe to actually feature in your bio. 
With Linktree, you only need one link. When a user clicks that link, they’ll be presented with links to both recipes.

This is an open project given by the SRM chapter of CodeChef(https://www.codechef.com/).

This project is a model linkTree with links to all my social media handles, created using basic HTML, CSS and Javascript. I have deployed this website using GitHub pages. You can find the website at https://annanya481.github.io/link.Tree/.
